### Older versions than A20

DMT is required to use this mod in versions older than A20. It is a tool for managing and applying mods to the game with support for the Harmony modding library, which this mod uses. Support for Harmony comes built-in for A20+ versions of the game, which is why DMT is only required for older versions.
